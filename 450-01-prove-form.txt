For questions 2-6, please type "True" or "False" in front of the question number.

true 2. My experiment shell can correctly load the Iris dataset:

true 3. My experiment shell randomizes the order of the instances (making sure to keep instances lined up with their appropriate targets) it and splits the data into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%)?

true 4. I have created a HardCoded classifier class with two methods: train and predict. The train method accepts training data (including targets). The predict method returns a prediction or classification for each instance it receives.

true 5. The Experiment Shell, processes the data, passes the training data to the classifierâ€™s train method, the test data to the predict method, and then compares the predicted values against the correct answers, to produce an overall accuracy (on the test set).

true 6. I have run the HardCoded classifier on the Iris dataset and obtained a result.

7. What accuracy do you get when running the HardCoded classifier on the Iris dataset and why do you think that is?

less than 40% that's because I hard coded it to always respond with "0". So only 33% of the data set is 0, so if I ran the entire set through the test it would give 33.3% every time. Now it's random a random test set, so sometimes more than 33% of the test set is 0.

8. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
4 - Meets requirements

9. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category: 
I went through the list in I-learn and incorporated every aspect of the required section in my program. The program runs as expected, it gives an accurate representation of the data.
